## Facial Expressions Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
### Branches:
- master : Contains files related to training the model and realtime testing. 
- deployment : Contains files related to deployment of the deep learning model on web using **flask** micro framework.  

### Description:
* Facial Expression Detection (csv) - This notebook contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using fer2013.csv dataset directly. 
* Facial Expression Detection (dir) - This notebook contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using fer2013.csv dataset using **Datagenerator Class of Keras** after splitting the csv dataset to directories. The code for converting the fer2013.csv file to directories is in **convertodir.py** 
* model_weights.h5 & model.json - These weights file and architecture file as json are generated after training the CNN model in **Facial Expression Detection (dir)** notebook. 
* model_filter.h5 & fer.json - These weights file and architecture file as json are generated after training the CNN model in **Facial Expression Detection (csv)** notebook.

### Dependencies:
* Python=3.7
* Tensorflow>=2.1
* opencv>=4.0.1
* keras>=2.3.1
#### Installation of dependencies using Anaconda distribution
`conda create -n faceexpressions python=3.7 -y`

`conda activate faceexpressions`

`pip install ipykernel`

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name faceexpressions --display-name "faceexpressions"`

If you have want to install Tensorflow GPU then use below command

`conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0`

If you have want to install Tensorflow CPU then use below command

`conda install tensorflow==2.0.0`

The below pip command installs keras, opencv, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

`pip install keras opencv-contrib-python pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

The below command install jupyter notebook on Anaconda Distribution

`conda install jupyter`

Once your dependencies installation is done, you can run the notebook files on jupyter notebook(if you are using Anaconda) using below command. 

`jupyter notebook`

### Real-Time Testing of our model:
* This can be done just by running **RealtimePredictions.py** 

`python RealtimePredictions.py` 

* You'll see a window pop up and you can find the predictions on your screen. (See the demo file below)
